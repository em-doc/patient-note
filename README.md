# Read Me 🚑🏥

Hate documenting patient notes in your clunky electronic health record? Try using this web application that holds on to your written notes in the `localStorage` object, allowing you to add it into the chart when needed.

## Getting Started

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JS interface with a very basic `Vue.js` framework implemented. Everything in this code is self-contained, meaning there are no dependencies or outside programs needed to operate.

## Use Cases

This is intended primarily for emergency medicine physicians who need to quickly output the results of a patient encounter while attending to more urgent needs.

## Have suggestions?

I'm all ears 😁
